	<h2>Some Facts</h2>
	
	<div class="content1">
	
	<br><br><br>The Sun, a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective 
	motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.</br></br>It formed approximately 4.6 billion
	years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud.</br></br>
	This star is directly or indirectly the only source of energy available to our planet, which is why since 
	ancient times there is a spiritual, religious and mystical relationship between beings with this celestial body, 
	is known that many diseases and disorders are cured by surgical exposure to sunlight.<br><br><br></br><center><img class="img3"

	<h2>Observational Conclusions</h2>
	
	<div class="content1">
	
	<br><br><br>The observation of the sun has led to the human race throughout thousands of years to know in detail its composition, 
	temperature, effects of its magnetic field, as well as create an idea of ??its behavior in the coming years, but there are also 	    theoretical 
	inconsistencies in the traditional sun scheme.<br><br> 
	It should be noted that conventional science does not explains many of the phenomena that originate 
	in and out of this celestial body such as where its energy comes from (&nbsp;&nbsp;~_~)&nbsp;!&nbsp;&nbsp;and the inexplicable    temperature difference 
	between the core and the crown, so it is practically still an unknown subject which will be clarified with the 
	development of quantum physics and new experimental techniques.<br><br><br><center><img class="img3"

	<h2>Solar Flares</h2>
	
	<div class="content1">
	
	<br><br><br>A solar flare is a sudden flash of increased brightness on the Sun, usually observed near its surface and in close proximity 
	to a sunspot group.</br></br>Powerful flares are often, but not always, accompanied by a coronal mass ejection.</br></br>Even    the most powerful flares 
	are barely detectable in the total solar irradiance.<br><br>
	Flares are closely associated with the ejection of plasmas and particles through the Sun's corona into outer space; flares also    copiously 
	emit radio waves.</br></br>If the ejection is in the direction of the Earth, particles associated with this disturbance can    	    penetrate into the upper 
	atmosphere (the ionosphere) and cause bright auroras, and may even disrupt long range radio communication. It usually takes    days for the 
	solar plasma ejecta to reach Earth.<br><br><br><center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/UW9bSA1.gif"
