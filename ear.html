	<h2>A World Designed to House Life</h2>
	
	<div class="content1">
	<br><br><br>
	<center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/oyfilo4.jpg" title="Plant Life" width="600" height="380"
	 alt="Forest on the Planet Earth"><br><br></center>
	<br>The remote possibilities of developing and maintaining life have only been able to occur in our world, 
	a favorable atmosphere where water cycles occur regularly, a safe distance from glare and solar ejections, 
	a moon that balances weather stations so as not to produce changes abrupt temperature, 
	among other factors make us really wonder if this is the work of nature or there is an intelligent design 
	for our planet.<br><br><br><center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/g11Lvvy.jpg" title="Desert Enviroment" 
	width="600" height="380" alt="Desert Dunes"><br><br><br></center>
    The vast biodiversity of species and habitable scenarios on earth makes it a unique case in the entire known universe.
    <br><br><br><center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/kllJYsf.jpg" title="Vulcanic Activity" width="600" height="380" 
	alt="Vulcano with Magma"><br><br><br></center>The balance between the uncontrollable natural forces that produce changes on the    planet and    habitable    environments is also a rare factor.<br><br>
	
	</div>
		
	<h2>The Acuatic World</h2>
	
	<div class="content1">
	
	<br><br><br>
	<center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/IgSxgaa.gif" title="Water Cycles" width="600" height="380" 
	alt="A  Waterfalls"><br><br></center>
	<br>Water is a pure substance widely seen in the universe mostly in the form of glaciers, it can be observed 
	in its different physical states from certain physical conditions, on planet earth this occurs sporadically, 
    and represents almost the entire surface composition except for land extensions, it houses millions of species and 
    living organisms in its depths.<br><br><br><center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/egI3bjr.jpg" title="Acuatic Life" 
	width="600" height="380" alt="Fishes on The Ocean">
	<br><br><br><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/sLsQ01k.jpg" title="Glaciers" width="600" height="380" 
	alt="Ararat Mountain"></center>
	
	</div>
	
	<h2>The Unknown Planet</h2>
	
	<div class="content1">
	
	<br><br><br>The fact that we know more about other celestial bodies than our own planet is disturbing, but how is this possible?
	<br><br><br><center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/XdsvJg8.jpg" title="Antartic" width="600" height="380"
	alt="Antartic Glaciers"><br><br></center><br>
	For example, the Antarctic continent which has been explored for the first time in the XX century along with technological 	    advances, however the difficult natural conditions of this place maintain unexplored regions.
    <br><br><br><center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZeQhxWT.jpg" title="Vostok Lake" width="600" height="380" 
	alt="Vostok Lake"></center><br><br><br>
    The Vostok Lake, has surface of this fresh water lake is approximately 4,000m under the surface of the ice, which places it 
    at approximately 500m below sea level.
    <br><br><br><center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/WhKdz5d.jpg" title="Russian Probe" width="600" height="380" 
	alt="Exploration Probe into The Ocean"></center><br><br><br>
    The overlying ice provides a continuous paleoclimatic record of 400,000 years, although the lake water itself may have been    isolated for 15 to 25 million years. On 5 February 2012, a team of Russian scientists completed the longest ever ice core of    3,768 and pierced the ice shield to the surface of the lake.
    <br><br><br><center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/UUYisVa.jpg" title="Vostok Station" width="600" height="380" 
	alt="Russian Antartic Station"><br><br></center><br>
    The team found 3,507 unique gene sequences from aerobic, anaerobic, psychrophilic, thermophilic, halophilic, 
	alkaliphilic, acidophilic, 
    desiccation-resistant, autotrophic, and heterotrophic organisms were present, including a number from multicellular eukaryotes 
    and this is only a small part of the unknown life forms that can be found there.
    <br><br><br><center><img class="img3" src="https://i.imgur.com/hA5bQXA.jpg" title="New Species" width="600" height="380"
	alt="Octupus on a Frozen Lake"></center><br><br><br>
    Another disturbing fact is the lack of knowledge about the fungi kingdom, about which only 50% of all species have been      	    classified, a type of plant organism that presents greater similarities as the animals they acquire their food by absorbing    dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment and whose properties and attributes have n    not been fully studied.
